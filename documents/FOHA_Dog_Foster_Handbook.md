## <a name="welcome"></a>Welcome to the FOHA Dog Foster and Adoption Advocate Program!

Fostering is one of the most selfless and gratifying aspects of animal rescue. When you open your heart and your home as a foster family, you are saving lives by making a short-term commitment of time instead of a life-time one. You are also becoming the dog's #1 adoption advocate and will help to get the dog adopted into their forever home as quickly as possible.

FOHA relies on foster families to help homeless dogs. Whether you are considering fostering or are a current foster parent, please take the time to read over the foster packet to learn about FOHA's foster program.

Remember that our volunteers and staff will gladly work with you to make your experience enjoyable and rewarding for you and your new foster.

Thanks again, and have fun with your new foster dog!

## <a name="rules-of-the-road"></a>Quick Reference: Foster Rules of the Road

- All foster dogs are property of FOHA at all times until adopted.

- As a foster you are the #1 adoption advocate for your foster dog. FOHA will promote your dog on social media, but due to the large number of animals we have available for adoption this may only be once a month.

- **The goal is to have dogs adopted.** With the exception of "Foster with Intent to Adopt" (FIA), fosters are required to take their dog either to the shelter to be seen or an event at least one time a month, some exceptions apply. Check with the foster coordinator prior to attending events. It is preferred for eligible foster dogs to attend 2 events per month (if applicable). Please post the dogs to our social media site for attention.

- **It is the foster's responsibility to promote their foster dog.** When they are not at the shelter, they are less likely to be seen by potential adopters. Weekly updates would be appreciated. Please see below for suggested promotion. You will also receive some additional information from Petcademy, the company that provides "post-adoption support" (also to fosters) for the first 30 days.

- If an adoption application is received for your foster dog, you will be expected to make the dog available for a meet and greet at a time and place that works best for you and the potential adopter. This can be done at the shelter, your home, or a public location. We recommend any dog introductions be done at the shelter unless otherwise agreed upon.

- The foster parent does not have the right to release custody of any FOHA foster dog to anyone other than a representative of FOHA.

- FOHA reserves the right to request the return of any foster dog. Upon request, the foster dog must be returned to the FOHA kennel or representative.

- Foster families agree to accept the animal at their own risk and release FOHA and its volunteers from any and all liability arising out of fostering the animal. This is acknowledged in the foster contract.

- FOHA will make ALL medical decisions regarding the health and safety of the animal.

- Fosters are not to provide medication, treatment, or training without prior approval from FOHA.

- FOHA pays for medical expenses with prior approval. Please email the Medical Manager to make an appointment to see a FOHA veterinarian at the shelter or get approval to see a FOHA approved veterinarian.

- FOHA will supply the appropriate heartworm and flea/tick preventative on a monthly basis.

- When you pick up your foster dog, you will be given a collar with a FOHA emergency tag. If you regularly foster a dog, please consider purchasing an engraved ID tag with your phone number on it. When the dog comes to the shelter or moves fosters the FOHA emergency tag should be transferred with the dog. If the dog is adopted the FOHA emergency tag should be returned to FOHA.

- You will also be provided a copy of the dog's medical records. If you take the foster to the vet, please ask for a copy of the medical records from the visit and add it to the medical records you were given. When the dog comes to the shelter, moves fosters, or is adopted, the medical records should be transferred with the dog.

- See Appendix I for FOHA Fostering FAQs.

## <a name="foster-program-introduction"></a>Foster Program Introduction

### What Types of Dogs are Available for Foster?

FOHA is contacted by individuals and other organizations to help with dogs on a daily basis. We can only help as many as our financial resources, shelter space and number of foster homes can accommodate. We are always in need of both short-term and long-term qualified fosters.

- Puppies and pregnant moms (please refer to puppy foster packet for puppies and moms)
- Adult dogs of all breeds and sizes
- Senior dogs of all breeds and sizes
- Dogs with health issues or who are recovering from illness or surgery
- Dogs who need significant socialization
- Dogs who are suffering from kennel stress
- Dogs who have spent a long time at the shelter awaiting their forever homes

### Selecting a Foster Dog: Let the Foster Team Help You Meet Your Match!

While the foster team will work with you to place a dog in your home that is a good fit, you know your family best. When describing the type of dog you are interested in fostering, please let the foster coordinators know the following:

- Do you have weight, size or breed restrictions where you live?
- Do you have experience with medical needs dogs? Would you be willing to foster a dog with medical issues?
- Are you willing to foster a dog that may not be housebroken?
- Do you have a confident, well-adjusted dog who could be a role model for an unsocialized and shy dog?
- Are you looking for a very active dog, a medium energy dog or a "couch potato"?
- Do you have physical limitations that would make it difficult to handle a larger/stronger dog?
- Are you away from home for long hours every day or for shorter periods of time? If you are gone for long hours, is there someone available to give the dog a midday break?
- Are you willing to foster for a few days? Weeks? Months?

## <a name="bringing-foster-dog-home"></a>Bringing Your Foster Dog Home and Daily Care

### Picking Up Your Foster Dog

- **CONTRACT** - A foster contract will need to be completed. The general contract will be good for any dog you choose to foster from FOHA. If you have a change of address a new foster contract will need to be completed. A Medical Disclosure and Bite Disclosure will need to be filled out for each individual dog.

- **COLLAR** - FOHA requires that foster dogs wear a collar with a FOHA emergency tag that is assigned a 4-digit number that will allow us to match your dog to you, as the foster, in case you ever lose your dog and she/he is found and FOHA is alerted. This collar must remain on the dog at all times and should be returned to FOHA when the dog is adopted.

- **LEASHES** - Bring a plain 4'- 6' leash (no retractable leashes please) when you come to pick up your dog. And remember, your foster dog MUST remain on leash unless s/he is in a securely fenced area. Even the most well-trained dog can take off and become lost or injured.

- **FOOD** - Please ask an office volunteer for a 5lb bag of the food given at the shelter. Our primary food at the shelter is Hills Science Diet. If you are only doing a short time foster we will send you home with enough food.

- **PARTIES** - Sure you want everyone to meet your new foster dog, but accomplish this slowly - don't have everyone over the first night. Remember, your dog has already been through a lot of changes in her/his life and just riding in a car, going home with you, and getting to know your house, is a very big event. Your dog will be much happier having enough time getting to know you before having to be the life of the party, too. Take introductions to new people, new places, and new situations slowly. We recommend that short term fosters do not meet new people, unless they are frequent visitors and already familiar with you and your home.

- **GROOMING** - Again, your dog is already having a lot of new experiences in a very short time. Give your dog a week or two to get used to you and the home before subjecting it to a new groomer. A quick bath a couple of days after coming home is okay.

- **BOLTING** - Keep a leash by each door you (and guests) use to go in and out of the house. Before opening any door, check where your new dog is and that there's no chance of sneaking out. If you need to keep the door open for a few minutes to bring in groceries, etc., leash your dog or put it outside or in another room until the door is completely secure.

- **HEARTWORM PILLS** - It is critical (and a FOHA requirement) that your dog receive one of these pills each month. FOHA will provide foster parents with heartworm pills which will be mailed monthly.

- **MEDICAL EMERGENCIES** - In the event of a medical emergency, please follow instructions provided in Appendix III. Copy and hang this page on the fridge, too!

- **NON-MEDICAL EMERGENCIES** - Paul Wilkerson please contact [medical@foha.org](mailto:medical@foha.org)

### Introducing Foster Dogs to Your Family Pets

**QUARANTINE FOR 7 DAYS PRIOR TO INTRODUCTION** if your foster dog has not gone through quarantine at FOHA.

- Please keep your foster dog(s) and resident dog(s) separate from each other for at least 7 days.
- Be on the alert for any health issues such as sneezing, coughing, lethargy, etc.
- Be aware that there are common illnesses after the quarantine period.
- Worms are not uncommon in rescue dogs. To this end, it is important to pick up your foster dog's waste immediately until you confirm that your foster dog has been dewormed.
- Contact the medical coordinator if you notice any health issues so that we can get your dog seen ASAP.

**INTRODUCTIONS**

- Grab a friend and take the foster dog and your dog on a casual walk. Let them follow and sniff each other prior to allowing them to go nose-to-nose.
- Introduce the dogs on neutral ground when possible.
- Remove food, toys and prized possessions from the equation when doing the dog introductions.
- If you have a cat, please be sure to prepare with baby gates and a high place for a cat to escape. For information on how to properly introduce your foster to a cat please click on the link: https://be.chewy.com/is-this-normal-my-cat-is-afraid-of-my-new-dog/
  - If you are providing short-term foster care, we recommend keeping the dog and cat(s) separated the whole time.
- If you need help, please do not hesitate to ask. FOHA is willing to help with introductions.

**Additional Tips for Keeping Your Resident Pets and Foster Dog safe When Interacting:**

- Always keep a foster mom and puppies separated from your resident dog.
- If the dogs are possessive of toys and possessions, keep them out of reach.
- Do not leave the dogs unsupervised together.
- Always feed the dogs in separate areas.
- Do not leave the foster dog alone unsupervised in the backyard. They may be destructive, escape artists or bark incessantly.
- A gated area or an enclosed room in the house is the best choice until you are 100% sure they are ok.

### Caring for Your Foster Dog - The Basics

#### FOOD AND WATER

- Water should be available at ALL times. Never withhold water from your foster dog.
- Dogs should be fed twice per day: once in the morning and once in the evening, Hills Science Diet and Purina Pro Plan are recommended by our vet. Top the kibble with a couple spoons of wet food.
- Feed your foster dog in a separate area from your resident pets. Most dog fights start over "resources" such as food or a toy.
- Please don't feed your dog human junk food.
- The following foods are toxic (even deadly) to dogs: chocolate, onions, grapes and raisins.
  - For a more extensive list click here.
- Do not feed your FOHA foster dog a raw diet.
- Do not give your dog bones from raw or cooked meat or meat that has bones in it.
- Dog treats within moderation are fine. Please try to ensure the treats are made in the USA.
- Caution: rawhides can be a choking hazard.

#### HOUSETRAINING

In some cases, your foster dog will not be housebroken and will need to be trained in this area. If your foster dog is not housetrained:

- You will need to take the dog outside frequently to use the bathroom. Making a log of bathroom behaviors is really helpful.
- When you take them out for a bathroom break, do not play with them or start out on your walk.
- Bring the dog outside and say "go potty"
- Once they eliminate, mark the behavior with a yes and give lots of treats.
- After the dog eliminates you can begin on your walk or engage in play, if the dog chooses to go back inside that is ok too.
- Never punish a dog for going inside and never rub the dog's nose in its accident. It will work against your training efforts. Instead, quickly leash the dog and bring him/her outside so they can finish their business.

#### BEHAVIORAL GUIDANCE

Some dogs may also need guidance on appropriate play, what they can and cannot chew on, and overall manners. While it is important to set boundaries, a dog should never be subjected to punishment such as screaming, yelling and physical correction.

- DO NOT use any training techniques using pinch/prong/choke collars, shaking penny cans, yelling, force or intimidation.
- ALWAYS use positive training techniques such as treats, toys, attention or space.

Report any behavior that is a concern to you to the Co-Coordinators foster team at [fosteradog@foha.org](mailto:fosteradog@foha.org).

#### SOCIALIZATION

- Do not take your dog out in public, especially to dog parks or pet food stores until the animal is fully vaccinated and has been cleared by FOHA to attend events and go to public places.
- Do not take your dog to dog parks to play with unknown dogs.
- Unless otherwise directed, most dogs benefit from socialization with different people of all ages in a variety of situations. There are exceptions to this. FOHA will identify dogs that should not be exposed to strangers.
- For more information on how to properly socialize a dog please click on the link: https://www.rover.com/blog/how-to-socialize-your-rescue-dog/

#### PROVIDING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

As you get to know your foster dog: Gating off an area of your home for your new foster dog when you leave the house will help keep the dog safe and your home intact while you are assessing whether your dog is housetrained and non-destructive, etc.

- Make sure the area is free from anything that can be a danger such as electrical cords, small items that the dog might choke on or ingest, poisonous plants, etc.
- Place items in this area such as a water bowl, feeding dish, dog bed (old towels and blankets work well for this purpose), safe chew toys, etc.
- Never leave a dog in the garage.
- Never leave a dog outside unattended.

### Notes on Crate Training

Usually gating a small area or confining a dog to a room while you are outside of the house will provide the proper mix of safe confinement while allowing the dog plenty of room to be comfortable. If the only way to safely contain the dog is a crate, make sure that the crate is always a positive place for your foster dog and large enough for the dog you are fostering and the dog is never left confined for more than 3-4 hours.

- Never use a crate for punishment.
- Many rescue dogs have never used a crate and may not adapt to being crated.
- When introducing a dog to a crate, use a happy tone of voice and tell the dog to "kennel up".
- Once the dog has entered the crate, give it lots of praise and perhaps a treat reward.
- If you have a difficult time getting the dog to enter the crate or if the dog seems afraid, try leaving the crate door open and placing the dog's food and water bowls just inside the door.
- Allow the dog to wander into the crate and eat at its leisure. Once the dog seems more comfortable with the crate, you can try confining the dog to the crate for short intervals.
- Never confine the dog to a crate for longer than 3-4 hours at a time. Remember, the dog will not want to soil its crate, so forcing the dog to stay in the crate longer than it can comfortably "hold it" is inappropriate.

### Lost or Missing Dogs

If the foster dog ever gets loose, you MUST call FOHA immediately and advise us of what has happened. We will help search for the dog, help make up posters and list the dog as missing on various websites. Please alert Laura Eddy (Operations Manager), [Lauraeddy@foha.org](mailto:Lauraeddy@foha.org), 571-342-2301.

Each dog has a FOHA Emergency Tag that must be worn at all times. This tag has a 4-digit number assigned and that number is recorded in our database.

## <a name="medical-protocol"></a>Medical Protocol and Procedures

### Health Monitoring

*(See Appendix II for Common Illnesses in Dogs)*

Take note of any changes you notice in the dog's behavior. Contact FOHA representatives right away if you notice any illnesses that may need medication or a veterinary appointment.

**Medical Coordinator:** Paul Wilkerson - [medical@foha.org](mailto:medical@foha.org)

**Emergency symptoms to look out for:** coughing, lethargy, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, inappetence for more than 12 hours, bleeding of any kind in the nose, urine or stool. 

If you notice anything of concern, contact the FOHA Medical Manager, Paul Wilkerson - [medical@foha.org](mailto:medical@foha.org), 703-346-8459 immediately. Please use his cell phone in emergencies only or if he initiates contact with you through his cell. Please keep in mind that FOHA employees are not on call 24-7 for non-emergency related discussions. We 100% appreciate your understanding!

For any symptoms that are not listed as an emergency, someone will be in touch within 24 hours with next step instructions.

**Important:** Do not give puppies and dogs any medications including flea and tick treatment and heartworm preventative unless you have prior approval. Puppies have to reach a certain age prior to being given many medications.

### Vaccinations and Check Ups

Fosters are required to bring their foster dogs to the shelter or pre-approved vet for scheduled vet visits. Some exceptions apply. Our Medical Manager will work with you to provide a schedule for vaccinations and discuss what vaccinations are best for the dog. In most cases, vaccinations will be done at FOHA. When visiting FOHA, please keep in mind that this is a high traffic dog area. If you are fostering a puppy, please keep the puppy up off the ground at all times. This is very important as we don't want puppies picking up any harmful diseases that may be lingering around. If you are fostering an adult dog, please don't allow them to go nose-to-nose with other dogs if your dog hasn't had all of its vaccines or is suffering from an illness.

### Spay/Neuter Appointments

Many of our dogs will need to be spayed or neutered. In some situations where an animal has a health issue, the spay/neuter procedure will be delayed. The vet will make the final determination of when a dog will need to be neutered or spayed. What you need to know:

- The Foster Coordinator and the Medical Manager will coordinate with you to schedule a spay/neuter appointment at one of our approved vets.
- Your dog MUST go into the appointment fasting (i.e., pick up all food prior to bedtime and do not feed it anything the morning of the procedure)
- You are responsible for transporting the animal to the appointment unless other arrangements are made.

### Vet Appointment Processes and Pre-Approval

*(See Appendix III for a list of non-emergency approved vets)*

FOHA has a vet that visits our shelter every other week. For emergencies and for spay/neuter, FOHA uses Blue Ridge Veterinary Hospital most often. There are also several specialty vet offices we use depending on the issue. All vet visits must be pre-approved, whether you are coming to the shelter for routine vaccinations or taking the dog to Blue Ridge for a spay/neuter.

**Please contact:** Paul Wilkerson (Medical Manager) - [medical@foha.org](mailto:medical@foha.org)

### MEDICAL EMERGENCIES

**Note:** see Appendix IV for approved emergency veterinary listings. Please print & hang on the fridge for quick access.

Contact one of the following FOHA contacts immediately in the case of an emergency: Unless it is an emergency please do not contact after office hours. In non-emergency situations calls and emails will be returned within 24 hours unless it is an off day.

1. Medical Manager, Paul Wilkerson - [medical@foha.org](mailto:medical@foha.org), 703-346-8459 - OFF Friday and Saturday
2. Senior Operations Manager, Laura Eddy, 571-342-2301, [lauraeddy@foha.org](mailto:lauraeddy@foha.org) - OFF Sunday and Monday
3. Executive Director, [Alisonmaurhoff@foha.org](mailto:Alisonmaurhoff@foha.org), 571-241-4196 - OFF Friday and Saturday
4. Foster Co-Coordinators: [fosteradog@foha.org](mailto:fosteradog@foha.org)
   - Diara - 240-355-3114
   - Eve - 914-456-2537

Depending on the time of day and where you are located, it may be that a non-emergency vet is a better choice than an emergency clinic. Please contact us immediately so that we can help you get the dog where it needs to go, call the clinic to tell them the dog is on the way and fax/email over the medical records. As always, use your best judgment.

## <a name="adopting-out"></a>Adopting Out Your FOHA Foster Dog
*(Not applicable to "FIA")*

### Adoption Events/Making Sure Your Foster Dog is Seen

Once your foster dog has been cleared by the vet to be in areas with other dogs, FOHA asks that you bring the dog to FOHA or to as many adoption events as possible when applicable.

### Adoption Process

- Potential adopter submits confidential application
- Application is approved or denied
- Potential adopters, including everyone who lives in the house and resident dogs, meet your foster dog, you can coordinate a time with the new potential adopter that works best. If you are coordinating an onsite meet and greet at FOHA please check with your Foster Coordinator on the agreed date and time.
- You provide the adoption and foster teams your input via an email on the meet and greet. We value your opinion and it is considered when making adoption decisions, however, final decisions are made by the adoption committee
- Pending adopters are scheduled for a virtual adoption consultation.
- Pending adopter and FOHA adoption committee decide whether it is a good match and whether to proceed with the adoption
- Coordinate a time with the Foster Coordinator, yourself and the new adopter to pick up the dog.
- Adopter pays the adoption fee, signs contracts and picks up their new dog

If someone expresses interest in adopting your foster dog, please have them visit www.foha.org to complete an online application. A FOHA volunteer will review the application and contact them.

### Sending Your Foster Dog to its New Forever Home

Once a decision has been made, you will be notified. You can then set up a convenient time for both parties to meet and give them their new furry family member.

When the dog leaves your care as a foster, please bring enough food to start the transition, and any remaining medication the dog needs.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If a dog has not been spayed/neutered, the dog cannot be adopted quite yet. It will go to its new home as a foster with intent to adopt. This means the new family will sign an agreement to foster the dog until it has been spayed/neutered. This foster agreement will not be the same as the initial foster agreement. The new owners will foster to adopt the dog and will not be required to have the dog meet other interested families. The dog will be removed from FOHA's website and will no longer be available. As soon as the spay/neuter occurs, the Adoption Contract can be completed and the adoption amount paid.

### Adoption Fee for Dogs

The adoption fees:
- Puppy (under 1 year old): $425
- Dog (1-8 years old): $375
- Senior Dog (8+ years old): Adoption fee waived, Senior Care Plan Eligible

### Can I Adopt My Foster Dog?

Please keep in mind while a dog is in foster care it is still considered available for permanent adoption. If you decide that you would like to make your foster dog a permanent member of your family, please contact:

**Foster Co-Coordinators:** [fosteradog@foha.org](mailto:fosteradog@foha.org)
- Donna - 703-932-8852
- Eve - 914-456-2537
- Diara - 240-355-3114

In most cases, fosters are given priority when applying to adopt their foster. A decision to adopt your FOHA foster must be made before it meets potential adopters. The permanent placement of any dog is up to the sole discretion of the Adoption Committee.

## <a name="promoting-foster"></a>PROMOTING YOUR FOHA FOSTER DOG

As your foster dog's Adoption Advocate, they need your help finding them their forever family. We love that they are away from the shelter, but it also reduces the chances of them meeting potential adopters. To counter that social media marketing is key to getting them visibility. As a foster we require you to market your foster dog once a week (if you are not on social media you can share information to our team to post on your behalf).

Here are some of the things you can do to help promote your foster dog:

### SOCIAL MEDIA

- Search for FOHA's Facebook GROUP - FOHA_VA
- You cannot comment on our main FOHA page
- Join the Group
- Post with pictures/videos and comments about how your foster dog is doing in a home!
- Always include the link to their profile page from our website! This easily connects interested people to the animal's page.

### REPORT Updates To

**Foster Co-Coordinators:** [fosteradog@foha.org](mailto:fosteradog@foha.org)
- Donna - 703-932-8852
- Eve - 914-456-2537
- Diara - 240-355-3114

Please include important information like:
- Is the dog potty trained?
- Does he/she have any separation anxiety
- How are the dog's house manners?
- How is the dog with other dogs/cats/children/strangers?
- What are the dog's likes and dislikes?

### COMMENT on the Dog's Bio Page

- Go to foha.org and find the dog's bio
- Scroll past the dog's bio and find the comment section. Post pictures and comments on how your foster dog is doing
- If you are new to commenting - you will have to create an account with DISQUS
- Comments need to be approved by an admin
- This can take 24-48 hours

### SEND Any Pictures/Videos To

- [petbios@foha.org](mailto:petbios@foha.org) and [fosteradog@foha.org](mailto:fosteradog@foha.org)
- These will be posted on our website, PetFinder and Adopt-A-Pet

## <a name="appendix-i"></a>APPENDIX I: FOHA FOSTER PROGRAM - FAQS

### Which dogs are in need of foster care?

**Short-term foster program**

Have a free weekend, extended holiday break or on a staycation, our shelter pups would love a mini vacation with you. Our dogs benefit greatly when they take a break from the shelter, and the information that you share about them helps us better match them with potential adopters.

**Regular foster program**

FOHA has many wonderful dogs currently residing at our shelter that are in need of foster care. Some are older, some have medical issues, and some are simply overlooked. These dogs can use a break from shelter life and would benefit greatly from the TLC provided from a kind foster family. The volunteers have a good idea of the dogs' personalities and can match you with a dog that would fit in well with your lifestyle.

### How long am I expected to foster a dog?

The length of the foster commitment is up to you and can range from a few days (to cover another foster's vacation) or until the dog is adopted.

### Will I need to buy supplies for my foster dog?

Foster families are expected to provide their dogs with food, toys, treats, etc. FOHA will provide food for short term fosters. FOHA covers any approved medical expenses and provides collars with our contact information for all of our dogs.

### What can I do to help get my foster dog adopted?

Foster parents are encouraged to be proactive in getting their dogs adopted into permanent homes. Foster dogs may be brought to the FOHA shelter by appointment during adoption hours (Friday, Saturday, Sunday, 12:00 pm - 5:00 pm) to be seen by adopters. Some foster parents have found great success in taking cute photos of their dogs and writing up a descriptive bio to be placed on the website or on the FOHA Facebook site. You are also welcome to attend FOHA's off-site adoption events if you give us advance notice and if your dog is approved to attend. Remember, the more exposure your dog gets, the faster he/she will get adopted.

### What if my foster dog has to go to the vet?

Vet care for foster dogs must be pre-approved by FOHA. All medical expenses are paid for by FOHA, but only if you take the animal to one of our approved vets. You may not take your foster dog to a different animal hospital unless you receive prior approval. FOHA receives a large discount from our partner vets Blue Ridge and Caring Hands Animals Hospitals. If there is an emergency after hours, you are still expected to call and email the emergency contacts. If you cannot reach a FOHA representative, take your foster dog to the emergency clinic.

### Does FOHA provide Monthly Preventatives?

Yes, it is mandatory that foster dogs are kept on monthly preventatives. If you are unable to pick them up from the shelter they can be mailed to you. Dogs that are in foster care for an extended period of time can be supplied with a few doses at a time. FOHA will not reimburse you for preventatives bought outside of one of our partner vets.

### Should I crate my foster dog?

Only if your foster dog needs one. Many of the FOHA dogs just need a quick refresher course with housebreaking, and then can be trusted in the house. If you are fostering a young dog that is likely to get into mischief while you are gone, FOHA can loan you a crate. We do not advocate crating your dog for more than 3-4 hours at a time, unless the dog is crated overnight. Baby-gating your dog in a safe room or area with food, bedding and water is a better alternative.

### What if my foster dog isn't working out?

Remember that all dogs have a transition period, so don't give up on your dog right away if there are minor issues. You may always contact the Foster Coordinator for assistance. If there is a major issue, you may return your foster dog to FOHA, but please contact the Foster Coordinator first to make sure that we have a run available.

### What if I have to leave town?

Please notify your Foster Coordinator as early as possible so that we have a run available at our shelter. If the dog has a medical issue and would not do well in the shelter environment, we will try to find a temporary foster home to care for the dog while you are away. Foster dogs must remain within our adoption area (the DC metro area) unless you are granted an exception.

### Can I adopt my foster dog?

Yes. If you decide to adopt your foster dog, contact the Foster Coordinator as soon as possible. As with all adoptions, you will need to complete an adoption contract and pay the adoption fee.

## <a name="appendix-ii"></a>APPENDIX II: COMMON ILLNESSES IN DOGS

The following information is intended to help you better understand and recognize some of the more common illnesses in dogs. If you have any suspicions of illness, please contact the medical manager, Paul Wilkerson (Medical Manager) - [medical@foha.org](mailto:medical@foha.org)

### Kennel Cough

Kennel cough is a respiratory tract infection that has been linked to several different viral and bacterial causes. Coughing is usually stimulated by physical exertion or by touching the throat area. Kennel cough is self-limiting, usually lasting 1-3 weeks. Antibiotics are often given to prevent secondary infections. Kennel cough is very common in shelters and other boarding facilities. There is a vaccine for Bordetella, one of the main agents responsible for causing kennel cough.

**This becomes an emergency if the dog stops eating, has loss of energy, is lethargic, vomiting, shivering or develops a fever (temp higher than 102°F).** This may mean it has become pneumonia and is an emergency. Contact FOHA right away for emergency approval.

| **Signs & Symptoms** | Cough, honking sound, foamy spit up, runny nose and eyes |
| **Treatment** | Veterinary care, including antibiotics and cough suppressants |
| **Transmission** | Very contagious to other dogs |

### Ear Mites/Ear Infection

Ear mites are tiny parasites that live in the ear canal. Ear infections cause inflammation in the ears due to bacteria or yeast. They present the same symptoms, with an ear infection you will notice redness inside the ear.

| **Signs & Symptoms** | Itching, scratching, head shaking, ear mites: dark brown discharge in the ears |
| **Treatment** | Ear drops/cleaning solution |
| **Transmission** | Ear mites can be transmissible to other dogs and cats, but it usually requires direct contact with the infected animal |

### Ringworm

Ringworm is a fungus related to athletes' foot; it's not actually a worm.

| **Signs & Symptoms** | Irregularly shaped areas of fur loss; the skin of the areas will usually appear rough and scaly |
| **Treatment** | Veterinary care: including diagnostic testing and/or topical treatment |
| **Transmission** | Highly transmissible to other dogs, cats and people, but usually requires direct contact with the infected animal |

### Fleas

Fleas are tiny insects that feed on the blood of dogs, cats, humans and other animals. Although each flea only consumes a small drop of blood, fleas usually attack in large numbers.

| **Signs & Symptoms** | Intense itching and scratching |
| **Treatment** | Veterinary care: including baths, medication and/or topical treatment |
| **Transmission** | Highly transmissible to other dogs, cats and people |

### Round, Tape, and Hookworms

Worms affect a dog's digestive system. They are most commonly seen in puppies and young dogs.

| **Signs & Symptoms** | Large belly, diarrhea, inability to gain weight |
| **Treatment** | Veterinary care: including fecal tests and de-worming medication |
| **Transmission** | Transmissible to other dogs and cats, but only through contact with (and subsequent ingestion of) feces |

### Urinary Issues

This could be due to a urinary tract infection or crystals in the urine.

**When it's an Emergency:** Little to no urine output could mean a blockage, and is a serious issue that needs to be seen by a vet immediately.

| **Signs & Symptoms** | Straining to urinate, having to urinate frequently, little to no urine output, blood in urine |
| **Treatment** | Veterinary care and urine test, antibiotics or prescription food may be needed |

### Fecal Issues

This can be due to an allergic reaction/upset stomach, stress, worms or parasites, gastrointestinal issues etc.

**Signs & Symptoms:** loose watery stool, soft stool, hard stool - causing straining to defecate, dark black stool, stool with large amounts of blood - small traces of blood is normal every now and then, not on a constant basis.

**When it's an Emergency:** 7-8 episodes of diarrhea in a 12 hour period, along with them not eating or drinking anything. Also when it is a very dark stool - black in color, or large amounts of blood in stool.

**Treatment:** veterinary care, medication/probiotics.

The chart on this site will tell you what to look for as far as normal and concerning stools: https://www.bigdogpetfoods.com/guides/whats-your-dogs-poo-telling-you

### Eye Infection

This could be due to an allergic reaction, an injury to the eye, or a bacterial infection of the eye.

| **Signs & Symptoms** | Overly watering eyes, redness around the inside of the eye, green thick mucus |
| **Treatment** | Veterinary care and eye drops, or allergy medication |

### Limping

This could be due to a sprain after playing rough or it could indicate a tear. Limping on the back leg is more worrisome as that is where most tears happen. If a dog starts to limp, please let someone know, we will monitor for a few days to see if the limping goes away. During this time, no rough playing or running, take on calm short walks and try to prevent any running. Usually with a sprain it just takes some time to rest and heal.

| **Signs & Symptoms** | Limping, lifting foot in the air, not bearing any weight on the foot/leg |
| **Treatment** | Radiographs may be needed, along with medication to help with pain and swelling |

### Cleaning Procedures

It is important that all items and areas used by a sick foster animal be cleaned thoroughly. You can use a 10% bleach solution to reliably kill most viruses and bacteria. Items to be cleaned should be thoroughly wetted with the bleach solution and allowed to stand for several minutes before rinsing. Foster homes that have recently fostered a dog or puppy with parvo or another extremely contagious disease may be asked to wait several months before fostering another unvaccinated dog or puppy.

## <a name="appendix-v"></a>APPENDIX V: FOHA RECOMMENDED DOG FOODS

Our vet recommend the following food:
- Hills Science Diet (this is what we feed our animals at the shelter unless a special diet is required)
- Purina Pro Plan

Please make sure the food of choice includes grains, unless told otherwise by FOHA.

When choosing dog food, avoid brands that contain: by-products, corn, bone meal, and artificial colors. Also check to make sure that they do not use BHA/BHT or ethoxyquin as preservatives. Many of the heavily-advertised grocery brands contain the above ingredients, and have little nutritional value. It is the equivalent of you eating McDonalds every day; it tastes good, but it is not healthy long-term.

High-quality foods can be fed in smaller quantities because they are more nutritious, which will help offset the higher price of the dog food. High-quality foods will also help to prevent your dog from developing health problems later in life, and will reduce the chances for food-related allergies.
