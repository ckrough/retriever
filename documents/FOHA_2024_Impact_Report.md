**FOHA is the enduring gold standard in quality for no-kill rescues, saving and improving the lives of homeless cats and dogs.**

### Our mission for 51 years and beyond

We strive to:

- Bring an end to euthanasia of adoptable companion animals
- Provide a safe haven for abused and abandoned animals
- Provide food, shelter, medical care, rehabilitation, and compassion to homeless animals
- Find permanent, loving homes for the animals in our care
- And, most importantly, bring about a time when there will be no more homeless pets and every dog and cat can be guaranteed a loving home

## LOOKING AHEAD

### LETTER FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

As we look ahead to 2025, exciting changes are on the horizon for FOHA! We're launching an upgraded website in the first half of the year, kicking off a capital campaign to fund our new Cat Adoption and Wellness Center, and enhancing promotions to increase adoptions—especially for senior and special needs animals. Our dog walking volunteers will continue to receive advanced training to better support each dog's unique needs. None of this would be possible without your dedication to our mission. Thank you for making FOHA the best temporary home for our animals and for helping us achieve another successful year!

With Thanks,  
**Alison Maurhoff**  
Executive Director
