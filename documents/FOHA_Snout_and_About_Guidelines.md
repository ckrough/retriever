# Snout and About Guidelines

## Prior to taking a dog out:

- Please sign up through our Volunteer Management System.
- Review the Rules and Guidelines
- Each week prior you will receive an email with the list of eligible dogs in a Google Sheet. You can sign up for a dog by simply typing your name on the day you'd like to take the dog.
- Please pay attention to days or dogs that are blocked off using RED.
  - This means the dog is no longer available OR there is an Adoption Event
    - Snout and About will not be available on days we have adoption events planned.

## Day of your outing:

- Please wear FOHA gear if you have it.
- You are responsible for transporting your dog.
  - It is recommended to use a back seat "hammock" or to cover your car seat with a blanket/towels either from home or borrowed from the linen shed at the shelter.

## At the Shelter

- Read the dog's file prior to grabbing the dog.
  - A lot of people ask about their history, age, where they came from, and any behavior information that we may have. Folders are in the file cabinet to the left of the Adoption Office Computer Desk.
- If your dog is not already wearing a collar with a FOHA tag, select a collar from the Adoption Office in the bin marked "FOHA TAGGED COLLARS" and make sure your dog has a FOHA tag.
- Please fill out the sign out sheet and make sure you include the dog's name, your name, phone number, and FOHA tag # from the collar you choose. This is important if the shelter needs your dog to return early.
- On your way up to get your dog, please grab a "Snout and About" sign from the Adoption Office and place it on your dog's run. Also if you cannot find it in the Adoption Office, please ask for help.
- Grab a Snout and About FOHA Bag and double check it is filled with:
  - Poop bags
  - Treats
  - Water Bowl
    - You can bring your own water bottle to fill or you can use a water jug from the bin outside the Adoption Office.
  - Extra Slip Lead
  - Snout and About Folder
- You may want to brush and/or freshen up your pup with some bath wipes if needed.

## During your outing:

- Anyone approaching a dog should be told to approach slowly and not lean over or get in the dog's face. Allow the dog to come to them.
- Try to take pictures and videos of your dog while they are out enjoying their adventure.
- If an incident happens with your dog, please stay calm but immediately report it to FOHA management.
- If your dog is not doing well while offsite, you are more than welcome to return the dog to the shelter.
- If someone expresses an interest in adopting the dog that you are handling, please ask them to submit an adoption application at foha.org.

## After your outing:

- Put the dog back in their run
- Put a clothespin on your dog's kennel board to indicate that he/she has been walked.
- Make sure they got dinner (if you had the dog away after 3:30).
  - Food will be labeled with the dog's name in the refrigerator.
- Return any shelter items back to the Adoption Office, including the OFFSITE Event sign and Snout and About Bag.
- Be sure to sign the dog back into the binder
- Share any pictures and videos
  - On the dog's bio page at foha.org
  - On social media
  - And/Or send to lauraeddy@foha.org
- Please complete the Dog Day Out Google Form to let us know how the dog did while out and about.
  - Link to the Google Form will be found on the Snout and About Sign Out Google Sheet as well as a QR code link in the sign out Binder in the Adoption Office.
