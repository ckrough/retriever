## Puppy Foster Program Introduction

### Welcome to the FOHA Puppy Foster Program!

FOHA relies on foster families to enable the shelter to help puppies – both orphaned puppies and litters with moms. The shelter environment is not ideal for puppies. Puppies need socialization to help them learn to be loving family members. Studies show that puppy's immune systems are not prepared to handle the exposure to disease that happens naturally in the shelter environment.

When you open your heart and your home as a foster family, you save the lives of many puppies that may otherwise be euthanized.

The purpose of this guide is to provide information to families who are considering fostering a puppy or a momma and puppies through FOHA to help you understand the responsibilities and commitments associated with this type of fostering. Once you've begun fostering, this guide can also help provide the guidance and resources you need to help you and your family provide the best care possible for your foster puppy.

### Foster families provide:

- Healthy and safe environment
- Puppy food (from our approved dog food list)
- Transportation to and from vet appointments and vaccination appointments
- Socialization with family members and friends
- Toys and bedding
- Interactions with different noises around your home and rich variety of experiences
- Coordinate meetings with potential adopters

### FOHA provides:

- All medical care expenses
- All vaccinations
- Pre-screening of all potential adopters
- Resources to help you foster successfully
- Opportunities for your foster puppy to be seen by the adoring public at adoption events (only after approved by a veterinarian)
- Help and guidance all along the way

### Fostering requires a flexible schedule and a personal commitment to the puppies.

On a typical day, you can expect to provide food and water two to three times a day. In most cases, puppies are not housebroken and will need to be trained in this area. They will need guidance on appropriate play, what they can and cannot chew on, and overall manners. They will need socialization with different people of all ages in a variety of situations. They may need medication or additional vet visits. As you can see, the time commitment to care for a puppy is not small – but it is well worth the time.

Although fostering is a lot of work, it is so rewarding for you and your family. You get to help puppies grow into confident, loving, and trusting family pets. You also get the fun of raising a puppy without the lifetime commitment of care (and expense). When you have a puppy in the house for entertainment, who needs television? Most importantly, you are saving lives!

## What Types of Puppies are Available for Foster?

FOHA is contacted by individuals and other organizations to help with puppies almost on a daily basis. We can only help as many as our financial resources and number of foster homes can accommodate. We are asked to help:

- Pregnant moms
- Orphans
- Puppies with no medical history
- Puppies with limited medical history (such as vaccinations done by another shelter)
- Highly socialized puppies
- Puppies who need significant socialization

You know your family best, so you know what kind of puppy you can accommodate.

## How Can I Make Sure My Pets Stay Healthy? How Do I Introduce My Foster Pets to My Resident Pets?

At FOHA, we want to make sure that our foster puppies and the pets of our foster families are safe and healthy. Therefore, to the extent possible, we require that all of your current family pets are up to date on their vaccines. Most puppies FOHA takes in have been seen by a veterinarian at the shelter they are coming from and have been given at least an initial set of puppy vaccines. In addition, FOHA tries to have our shelter vet examine puppies prior to being placed in a foster home, however, this is not always possible.

### CRITICAL

**Puppies should not walk on outside communal ground like parks, sidewalks, streets where dogs other than a resident dog have walked until they have received their second distemper vaccination.** Walking on communal ground exposes them to deadly parvo and distemper. This is extremely expensive to treat. Keep your puppy in the backyard as briefly as possible to potty and then bring them back inside. If you need to bring your puppy to the vet or FOHA, you must hold the puppy at all times.

### IMPORTANT

Please keep your foster dogs and resident dogs separate from each other for at least the 7 day quarantine period. During this time, please be on the alert for any health issues such as sneezing, coughing, lethargy, etc. If you notice anything at all, please contact the foster team so that we can get your puppy seen as soon as possible. Even if the puppy is illness free and your resident pets are completely vaccinated, worms are not uncommon in puppies. To this end, it is important to pick up the pup's waste immediately, at least until the fecal test has been returned and you are assured the puppy does not have any type of worms.

### Additional Tips for Keeping Your Resident Pets and Foster Puppy Safe When Interacting:

- Always keep a foster mom and puppies separated from your resident dog. Puppies need at least two distemper vaccines plus 14 days from the last distemper vaccine before they can be introduced to other dogs.
- It is also important that foster homes keep their puppies physically separated from their personal dogs for the duration of the puppies' stay. Newborn puppies are extremely vulnerable to illness. While your personal dogs may be vaccinated and thereby protected from various illnesses, your dogs can still carry and transmit illnesses they have been exposed to.
- Do not leave the dogs unsupervised together, unless they are puppies from the same litter.
- Always feed the dogs in separate areas
- Be aware that there are common illnesses in foster dogs that may not show up for 1-2 weeks and your own dog will potentially be exposed to this illness after the quarantine period.
- Do not leave the foster puppies alone unsupervised in the backyard. They can start to go out in the backyard at 6 weeks of age, they still cannot be around other dogs besides mom until they have their second distemper vaccine. They may be destructive, escape artists or bark incessantly. A gated area or an enclosed room in the house is the best choice.
- If you have a cat, only introduce them to the foster dog if they are a dog savvy cat. Keep in mind that a cat will always need a place to retreat to if they feel threatened. Old school baby gates blocking certain areas so that only a cat can squeeze through or jump over work well.

---

## Providing a Safe Environment

Gating off an area of your home for the puppy will help keep the puppy safe and your home intact. Make sure the area is free from anything that can be a danger to the puppy. For instance, electrical cords, furniture or other items in your home that the puppy may chew on, small items that the puppy might choke on or ingest, plants, etc. Place items in this area such as a water bowl, feeding dish, dog bed (old towels and blankets work well for this purpose), safe chew toys, etc.

### NOTES ON CRATE TRAINING

Usually gating a small area (like kitchen or laundry room) or using a wire exercise pen will provide the proper mix of safe confinement while allowing the puppy plenty of room to be comfortable. If the only way to safely contain the puppy is a crate, make sure that the crate is always a positive place for your foster dog. Never use a crate for punishment. When introducing a dog to a crate, use a happy tone of voice and tell the dog to "kennel up." Once the dog has entered the crate, give her lots of praise and perhaps a treat reward. If you have a difficult time getting the dog to enter the crate or if the dog seems afraid, try leaving the crate door open and placing the dog's food and water bowls just inside the door. Allow the dog to wander into the crate and eat at her leisure. Once the dog seems more comfortable with the crate, you can try confining the dog to the crate for short intervals.

**Never confine a puppy to a crate for longer than two hours at a time.** Remember, the dog will not want to soil his crate, so forcing the dog to stay in the crate longer than he can comfortably "hold it" is inappropriate.

It is also important that you do not take your puppy to dog parks or Pet Food stores until the animal is fully vaccinated and has been cleared by FOHA to attend events and go to public pet stores/parks as their immune systems may not be able to handle various illnesses they would be exposed to.

## Daily Care and Socialization

### Health Monitoring

Take note of any changes you notice in the puppy's behavior. Also be on the lookout for coughing, lethargy, diarrhea, vomiting, runny discharge from eyes or nose, or bleeding of any kind in the nose, urine or stool. If you notice anything of concern, contact FOHA's Medical Manager, Paul Wilkerson (medical@foha.org).

### Feeding

FOHA will provide you with a 5 lb bag of puppy food. The vet will make a recommendation on how much and how often the puppy will need to be fed. Most puppies will need to be fed more often than your adult dogs, typically three times a day. Puppies will start to eat a slurry of soaked dry food, water and some wet food around 4 weeks of age.

### Playtime

Playtime is an excellent time for puppies to get in some much needed exercise, learn important boundaries when playing and bond with their human friends. If a puppy gets over excited, playtime can become too rough and, although it may not seem like a big deal now that he or she is so small, once they are full grown it can become dangerous. You can avoid this by keeping play time at a lower level of excitement and by gently reminding the puppy that their nips hurt, by crying out when they nip you.

### Socialization

Puppies need to be able to be comfortable in many situations. They learn this by being exposed to a variety of environments, people and other pets. However, it is important to remember that a puppy's immune systems are compromised until they are properly immunized. **Puppies need at least two distemper vaccines, plus 14 days from the last distemper vaccine before they are able to be around other dogs or in areas with high traffic of other dogs** (parks, restaurants, pet stores, etc.). Until it is safe, you can help socialize a puppy by having guests offer treats and pet the puppy while visiting.

### Handling

The more often puppies are gently handled, the better the bond they will have with their human companions. Offer gentle massages, paying close attention to areas that can become sensitive to dogs, for instance paws, nails, ears, and such. This way, when it's time for them to be groomed or examined they will handle it with confidence.

If you have children in your household or visiting, it is important to always supervise their interactions. The puppies are still fragile and have sharp teeth! Remind children that they must not handle and play with the puppy constantly and that they need to let the puppy sleep and eat undisturbed. This is a great opportunity to teach the children how to handle the puppy gently so they don't accidentally hurt him and that a puppy's mouthing behavior is not biting, he is not trying to hurt them.

### Housebreaking

Most puppies will not be housebroken. It is important to be consistent with training a puppy to go to the bathroom outdoors. A set schedule of feeding, bathroom, playing, and resting will assist you in quickly training the puppy. It is necessary to frequently take the puppy outside to use the bathroom, praise them when they go, and bring them back inside immediately when finished. A puppy should never be scolded for going inside, and you should never rub the puppy's nose in its accident. It will work against your efforts. Instead, quickly scoop up the puppy and bring him or her outside so they can finish their business outside. Inside accidents should be cleaned up promptly using an enzyme based product like Nature's Miracle to eliminate any residual scent which could be an 'invitation' for the puppy to relieve themselves in the same spot again.

### Training

**DO NOT** use any training techniques using squirt bottles, pinch/prong/choke collars, shaking penny cans, yelling, force or intimidation.

**ALWAYS** use positive training techniques such as treats, toys, attention or space.

**ALWAYS** keep your puppy's collar with ID on at all times. He may scratch at it while he gets used to it, but it is important for him to become comfortable wearing a collar.

**NEVER** let your puppy outside without a leash attached unless he is in a securely fenced area.

Report any behavior that is a concern to you to the Foster Team. The more we know, the more we can work with these behaviors. Email Diara Washington (fosteradog@foha.org) if you have any questions/concerns about a dog's behavior.

### Chewing

Destructive chewing is a phase that all puppies go through. It usually starts around three months and can last until the dog is one year old. During this time, the dog's adult teeth are coming in and chewing helps relieve the pain. The best solution for destructive chewing is providing your foster puppy with something that is acceptable to chew on. Have plenty of chew toys available at all times. If you catch the dog chewing on something inappropriate, tell the dog "NO" in a firm (but not angry) voice, and replace the item with something more appropriate, like Nylabones for puppies. Please do not let them chew on rawhide bones as they can become a choking hazard.

If the destructive chewing occurs when you are away, consider confining the dog to a wire exercise pen, kitchen or crate (if the chewing becomes a safety hazard to the puppy). It is also important to make sure that your foster puppy is getting plenty of exercise. A tired dog will sleep, not chew!

## Medical Protocols and Processes

### Important

**Do not give puppies any medications including flea and tick treatment and heartworm preventative unless you have prior approval.** Puppies have to reach a certain age prior to being given many medications.

### Vaccinations and Check-ups

Fosters are required to bring the puppy to the shelter for scheduled vet visits. Our shelter veterinarian will work with you to provide a schedule for vaccinations and discuss what vaccinations are best for the puppy. We will also do fecal tests and deworm the puppies. In most cases, vaccinations will be done at FOHA. When visiting FOHA with a puppy, please keep in mind that this is a high dog traffic area. **Please keep the puppy up off the ground at all times.** This is very important, as we don't want puppies picking up any harmful diseases that may be lingering around.

Here is a typical vaccine schedule for puppies:

#### Puppy Vaccination Schedule

| Puppy's Age | Recommended Vaccinations | Optional Vaccinations (not covered by FOHA) |
|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 6 to 8 weeks | Distemper, measles, parainfluenza, Bordetella | None |
| 10 to 12 weeks | DHPP (vaccines for distemper, adenovirus [hepatitis], parainfluenza, and parvovirus), Bordetella | Coronavirus, Leptospirosis, Lyme disease |
| 12 to 24 weeks | Rabies | None |
| 14 to 16 weeks | DHPP | Coronavirus, Lyme disease, Leptospirosis |
| 12 to 16 months | Rabies, DHPP, Bordetella | Coronavirus, Leptospirosis, Lyme disease |
| Every 1 to 2 years | DHPP, Bordetella | Coronavirus, Leptospirosis, Lyme disease |
| Every 1 to 3 years | Rabies (as required by law) | None |

### Spay/Neuter Appointments

The puppy will also need to be spayed or neutered, usually around 6 months of age. The vet will make the final determination of when the puppy will need to be neutered or spayed, and FOHA will help you to schedule the appointment with the vet if the puppy is still with you at this point.

### Vet Appointment Processes and Pre-approval

FOHA has a vet that visits our shelter every other Tuesday. For emergencies and for spay/neuter, FOHA has several vets we use. There are also several specialty vet offices we use depending on the issue. Any vet visit must be pre-approved, whether you are coming to the shelter for routine vaccinations or taking the dog for its spay/neuter. Please contact Paul Wilkerson (medical@foha.org) for assistance/approval in getting an appointment.

## Adoption Process, Events and Promoting your Puppy
Please reference Foster Handbook

### IMPORTANT NOTE

**If a puppy has not been spayed/neutered, the puppy cannot be adopted.** It will go to its new home as a foster with intent to adopt (FIA). This means the new family will sign an agreement to foster the puppy until it has been spayed/neutered. This foster agreement will not be the same as the initial foster agreement. The new owners will be foster to adopt the puppy and will not be required to have the puppy meet other interested families. The puppy will be removed from FOHA's website and will no longer be available. As soon as the spay/neuter occurs, the Adoption Contract can be completed and the adoption amount paid.

### Adoption Fee for Puppies

- The adoption fee for puppies under a year old is **$425**
- The adoption fee for dogs over a year old is **$375**

## Reference Appendix: Common Illnesses in Puppies

The following information is intended to help you better understand and recognize some of the more common illnesses in puppies. If you have any suspicions of illness, please contact Paul Wilkerson (medical@foha.org) immediately.

### Canine Distemper

Canine distemper is a viral disease that is often fatal. Distemper is most commonly seen in puppies 3-6 months old. Early signs resemble a severe cold. The vaccine for canine distemper is considered very effective.

| Signs & Symptoms | Eye congestion and discharge, loss of appetite, coughing, weight loss, nasal discharge, and diarrhea |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Treatment** | Veterinary care, including fluid therapy and antibiotics |
| **Transmission** | Very contagious |

### Parvovirus

Parvo is a disease that is most common in puppies and young dogs. It causes the sloughing of the lining of the intestinal tract. Parvovirus can survive in the environment for six months or longer. This means that other unvaccinated dogs can become infected with parvo simply by coming into contact with places where an infected dog has been. A bleach solution is the best way to disinfect areas that may have been contaminated. The vaccine for parvovirus is considered very effective.

| Signs & Symptoms | Lethargy, loss of appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea (usually bloody) |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Treatment** | Veterinary care, including fluid therapy and antibiotics |
| **Transmission** | Very contagious to other dogs, especially through contact with infected feces or vomit |

### Kennel Cough

Kennel cough is a respiratory tract infection that has been linked to several different viral and bacterial causes. Coughing is usually stimulated by physical exertion or by touching the throat area. Kennel cough is self-limiting, usually lasting 1-3 weeks. Antibiotics are often given to prevent secondary infections. Kennel cough is very common in shelters and other boarding facilities. There is a vaccine for bordetella, one of the main agents responsible for causing kennel cough.

| Signs & Symptoms | Cough, runny nose and eyes |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| **Treatment** | Veterinary care, including antibiotics and cough suppressants |
| **Transmission** | Very contagious to other dogs |

### Ear Mites

Ear mites are tiny parasites that live in the ear canal.

| Signs & Symptoms | Itching, scratching, head shaking, dark brown discharge in the ears |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Treatment** | Veterinary care, including an injection or ear drops |
| **Transmission** | Contagious to other dogs and cats, but usually requires direct contact with the infected animal |

### Ringworm

Ringworm is a fungus related to athletes' foot; it's not actually a worm.

| Signs & Symptoms | Irregularly shaped areas of fur loss; the skin of the areas will usually appear rough and scaly |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Treatment** | Veterinary care, including an injection and/or topical treatment |
| **Transmission** | Very contagious to other dogs, cats and people, but usually requires direct contact with the infected animal |

### Fleas

Fleas are tiny insects that feed on the blood of dogs, cats, humans and other animals. Although each flea only consumes a small drop of blood, fleas usually attack in large numbers.

| Signs & Symptoms | Intense itching and scratching |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Treatment** | Veterinary care, including an injection and/or topical treatment |
| **Transmission** | Very contagious to other dogs, cats and people |

### Round, Tape, and Hookworms

Worms affect a dog's digestive system. They are most commonly seen in puppies and young dogs.

| Signs & Symptoms | Large belly, diarrhea, inability to gain weight |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Treatment** | Veterinary care, including deworming medication |
| **Transmission** | Contagious to other dogs and cats, but only through contact with (and subsequent ingestion of) feces |

### Cleaning Procedures

It is important that all items and areas used by a sick foster animal be cleaned thoroughly. You can use a 10% bleach solution to reliably kill most viruses and bacteria. Items to be cleaned should be thoroughly wetted with the bleach solution and allowed to stand for several minutes before rinsing. Foster homes that have recently fostered a dog or puppy with parvo or another extremely contagious disease may be asked to wait several months before fostering another unvaccinated dog or puppy.

## Reference Appendix: Fostering Pregnant Moms and Newborn Puppies

### PREGNANCY, LABOR, AND BIRTH

#### Pregnancy

During her last week of pregnancy, a mother dog may not have a big appetite because the puppies are crowding her organs. Feed her several small meals daily rather than one or two larger meals. Leave dry dog food and water out at all times. If the mother dog will not eat the food provided, try mixing it with a small amount of meat or other gravy-flavored or moist dog food.

Prepare a nesting box; place it in a dry, warm, relatively dark, draft-free place out of the way. Lead the mother dog to the box. If she does not want to stay in it, do not insist, but encourage her by petting her and giving her little food treats.

If your nursery room is not warm enough, wrap a heating pad in a towel, set it on the lowest setting, and place it under half the box so the mother has room to move away from the heat source if she chooses. You may consider wrapping duct tape around the cord; otherwise, the puppies will be apt to chew on it.

#### Labor

Before the delivery, the mother dog may become very irritable and restless. She will search for a place to have her puppies. Try to place her in the designated nesting box. She may choose another location to give birth, so it may be helpful to place the box in a room without any hiding places. Let her have the puppies outside of her nest box if she chooses. When delivery is complete, you may then move the mother and the puppies into the box. Some mother dogs may become protective of their new litters. Talk to her in a gentle, calm voice during this time. If she still acts aggressive, make sure the environment is safe and warm for the puppies, and leave her alone until she is less anxious.

Some dogs may want you to stay with them and will follow you if you leave. You will probably have to spend some time soothing this kind of dog. After the birth of the first couple of puppies, she will be very busy and not as dependent on your presence. Other dogs will try to get away and hide when in labor. Give this kind of dog the space she needs to feel comfortable, but check up on her regularly.

#### There are three stages of canine labor:

**Stage 1:** During the first stage, which may take up to 12 hours, the mother may breathe rhythmically. She may become very active, dig at the floor, cry loudly and appear to be straining while defecating.

**Stage 2:** In the second stage, the water bag breaks and straw-like fluid is passed. Delivery will begin a few minutes later. The mother dog will lick the newborn puppies clean and bite through the umbilical cord. She is bonding with her puppies through this process and learning to recognize them as her own. It is very important that you do not disturb her. It may appear as though she is too rough, but she is actually stimulating breathing and increasing blood circulation in the puppies.

**Stage 3:** In the final stage, the placenta follows a few minutes after delivery. The mother will probably eat some or all of the placenta.

#### Birth

Puppies are born anywhere from 15-30 minutes apart, so most deliveries take 2-6 hours. The average litter is 4 to 5 puppies. The mother dog is probably finished giving birth if she seems calm and happy, although there have been some cases in which a dog resumed delivery sometime later. **If a puppy is not born within 2 hours and the mother is continually straining or appears to be in distress, you should seek emergency veterinary care as soon as possible.**

### THE FIRST 8 WEEKS OF LIFE

#### Week 1

- A nursing mother dog cannot be overfed. Food requirements can increase up to three times the normal amount. Leave food out for the mother dog at ALL times.
- The floor temperature of the nest box should be between 96 and 100 degrees.
- The puppies' ear canals open when they are between 13 and 17 days old.
- The puppies' weight will vary according to their breed but they should be gaining about 1 to 1 1/2 grams per day for each pound of anticipated adult weight. They should be handled as little as possible.
- Puppies will sleep 90% of the time and nurse from their mother the other 10%. They should nurse vigorously and littermates should compete for nipples.
- Puppies can nurse for up to 45 minutes at a time.
- Chilling is the number one danger to newborn puppies, so keep them warm.
- Try to watch the puppies nurse at least once a day. Make sure every puppy is nursing and there is not too much maneuvering for position. A great deal of activity and crying could indicate a problem with milk flow or quality. When the mother dog re-enters the nest box, there should be fussing for only a few minutes before the puppies settle down.
- The mother may have diarrhea for a few days after the birth. It is recommended you have some canned pumpkin on hand to add to her food. Check with the vet about giving her a probiotic like Fortiflora, and possibly having that on hand as well.

#### Week 2

- The floor temperature of the nest box should now be 90-95 degrees.
- The puppies should continue to gain about 1 to 1 1/2 grams per day for each pound of anticipated adult weight.
- The puppies' eyes will open when they are between 10 and 14 days old. They open gradually, usually starting from the nose outward.
- All newborn puppies have blue eyes and initially no pupils can be distinguished. The eye color is a solid, dark blue.

#### Week 3

- The mother dog will begin to spend more time out of the nest.
- The floor temperature of the nest box should now be 85-90 degrees.
- The puppies should continue to gain about 1 to 1 1/2 grams per day for each pound of anticipated adult weight.
- The puppies should now be spending only 60-70 percent of their time sleeping.
- Puppies generally are able to stand around day 15 and can usually crawl by day 21.
- The puppies' milk teeth will begin to cut.
- Puppies will begin to play with each other, learn to sit, and will start trying to touch objects with their paws.
- During week 3, puppies should begin their socialization phase. Start to increase the amount of handling the puppies receive and try to accustom them to human contact. Avoid exposing them to anything frightening.

#### Week 4

- The floor temperature of the nest box should be 75-80 degrees from this point forward.
- The puppies should continue to gain about 1 to 1 1/2 grams per day for each pound of anticipated adult weight.
- Adult eye color will begin to appear, although it may not be final for another 9 to 12 weeks. The puppies will begin to develop complete sound and sight orientation.
- Puppies will begin to clean themselves, although their mother will continue to do most of the serious cleaning.
- Puppies can begin to eat from a shallow saucer and should be weaned gradually from their mother's milk. The mother dog will usually begin to discourage her puppies from nursing; however, some dogs (particularly those with smaller litters) will allow nursing until the puppies are around two months old.
- Sometimes, nursing activity is done just for comfort. Even if the puppies appear to be nursing, they may not be receiving all the nutrition they need. Make sure they are eating and gaining weight.
- Puppies will begin eliminating on their own. Supply newspaper or puppy training pads and encourage them to use this area.

#### Week 5

- The puppies should continue to gain about 1 to 1 1/2 grams per day for each pound of anticipated adult weight.
- The male puppies' testicles will become visible.
- The puppies should be very active and be able to get out of the nest.
- Weaning and house-training should continue.

#### Week 6

- The puppies should continue to gain about 1 to 1 1/2 grams per day for each pound of anticipated adult weight.
- The puppies should have complete visual abilities. They will imitate their mother, play with toys, and explore the world around them.
- Continue the weaning process by thickening the gruel. Begin to introduce solid food.

#### Week 7

- The puppies should continue to gain about 1 to 1 1/2 grams per day for each pound of anticipated adult weight.
- Nursing sessions should be brief and infrequent, if they take place at all.
- The puppies should now eat undiluted puppy food. Continue to encourage the puppies to eat dry food. Dry food is good for their teeth and will likely be what they are fed in their adoptive homes.

#### Week 8

- The puppies should continue to gain about 1 to 1 1/2 grams per day for each pound of anticipated adult weight, and be ready to be spayed or neutered.

### ORPHANED PUPPIES

Sometimes, newborn puppies are orphaned. Success with raising these newborns is based on following basic procedures and keeping important elements in mind. Successful rearing of orphaned puppies requires providing them with a suitable environment, the correct quantities of nutrients for different stages of growth, and a regular schedule of feeding, sleeping, grooming and exercise.

You must also provide the stimulus for urination and defecation during the first 18-21 days of life. Do this by massaging the abdomen and peri-anal area after each feeding with a cotton ball or very soft washcloth dampened with warm water (you don't want to irritate the area). You can also use mineral oil on a cotton ball to stimulate the bowels. Puppies, after 4 weeks of age, can usually eliminate without assistance.

You must also maintain their body warmth for them, as puppies do not have the ability to regulate and control their body temperature. Keep them out of drafts. If necessary, use a 250-watt infrared heat bulb suspended above the crate. If you need to use a heating pad, place it in front of their sleeping area, at the opening of the crate, and cover it with several layers of towels.

Puppy bedding must be changed daily, and sometimes more often. Wash dirty bedding with a little bleach to disinfect it.

Puppies need exercise to promote muscular and circulatory development. However, care should be taken in the first two weeks of life because their internal organs and limbs are extremely fragile. Play with and handle them prior to feeding. At least twice a week, and more often if possible, the babies need to be groomed with a soft, warm, moist cloth wiped gently, imitating the mother's grooming licks.

Cow's milk is not nutritious enough for puppies; they will slowly starve to death on it. Purchase Esbilac from a veterinary clinic or pet supply store for feedings.

Test the temperature of the Esbilac before feeding. It should be warm, but not hot: around 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Don't boil the Esbilac, since it will destroy the nutritional value. To warm the Esbilac, place the bottle in hot water for a few minutes or put it in the microwave for no more than 10 seconds.

If constipation occurs, add 1 drop of vegetable oil to each puppy's food no more than once daily until the problem eases. Overfeeding can cause diarrhea and a host of other problems.

Hand-feeding can be challenging and yet very rewarding. Everyone who has done this has developed a method that works best for them; you will, too. Whether you use a baby animal bottle or a syringe, it's best to keep the puppy in a position similar to what she would experience if mama were there. In other words, don't turn the baby on her back. Keep the bottle at a 45-degree angle to reduce the amount of air getting into the puppy's stomach.

#### Puppy Feeding

Feeding equipment needs to be sterilized before and between feedings. Do this by dipping the equipment in boiling water. Sterilize your hands before and after feedings. Below are general guidelines for how much to feed and when:

| Week of life | Amount | Frequency |
|--------------|--------|-----------|
| 1st week | 60 ml per pound | 4 times a day |
| 2nd week | 70 ml per pound | 3 times a day |
| 3rd week | 80 ml per pound | 3 times a day |

As long as the puppy does not cry excessively, gains weight, and feels firm to the touch, the diet is meeting his nutritional needs.

After each feeding session, you should give each puppy a full-body once over with a barely damp washcloth, using short strokes like mom would use. This keeps their fur clean, teaches them how to groom, and gives them the attention and mothering that they crave.

### NOTES: Here is some additional information on techniques for socialization, weaning, and house-training.

#### Socialization

It is your job to help convince the puppies that humans are kind and loving. Some puppies will adjust to you and their new environment quickly, while others may seem frightened and intimidated. To help the puppies get used to you, try sitting down in the middle of their room while making phone calls. They will hear the sound of your voice, but not be threatened by it. Familiarize them with the sound of the television and radio.

When the puppies are nearly four weeks old, they are ready to socialize with you and each other. Try to play with your puppies daily. The outgoing and friendly puppies will be easy to play with; however, some will need a little encouragement. If your puppies are afraid and run away when you approach, try sitting or lying on the floor near them and letting them come to you. When you pick a puppy up, stroke the puppy gently and speak to him in a soft tone. You want this to be a pleasant experience, so put the puppy down if he begins squirming a lot. With patience and love, most puppies will come to tolerate and even enjoy the company of humans.

#### Weaning

At about 4 weeks of age, the puppies will probably start showing interest in their mom's food. Introduce the puppies to solid food by offering warmed canned food mixed into a thin gruel with a little bit of water or Esbilac. Place the food in a shallow saucer. Some puppies will begin lapping right away, while others will prefer to lick the gruel from your fingers. Allow them to do so and slowly lower your finger to the saucer. The puppies may bite the edge of the plate or walk in the food. Sometimes it takes two or three meals or more before they really catch on. If a puppy doesn't seem interested in the gruel at all, try gently opening the puppy's mouth and rubbing a little of the food on her tongue or teeth. Be patient; the weaning process takes time. As the puppies catch on, begin to thicken the gruel in the proceeding weeks. Remember that as you thicken the gruel, you will need to make sure the puppies always have access to fresh water in a low, spill-resistant bowl.

By about 6 weeks of age, the puppies should be getting most of their nutrition from the food you are providing. The puppies should be fed at least 3 meals a day. Their stomachs are small and so they may not eat much at a single sitting. To receive adequate nutrition, the puppies require small, frequent feedings. Gradually introduce the puppies to dry food by mixing it in with their gruel. By the end of 8 weeks, the puppies should be content to eat dry food alone.

Do not give the puppies cow's milk or other human foods. Dogs and puppies have different nutritional needs than humans and can become ill when given some human foods.

#### House-training

When the puppies reach about 4 weeks of age, they will begin to eliminate on their own. You can create an elimination area with newspapers or puppy training pads. You can encourage the puppies by showing them the newspaper or pads several times a day, especially after meals and naps. Gently put the puppy on the pad and praise him if he uses the spot to eliminate. It is, of course, common for young puppies to make mistakes. If you find that a puppy has defecated outside of the newspaper or pad area, pick up the puppy, take him to the appropriate area, and set him down. This should help remind the puppies where they are supposed to eliminate. It is a good idea to confine the puppies to a relatively small area because they may forget where the elimination area is located if they have too much room. Be sure to always keep the area clean and away from their food.
