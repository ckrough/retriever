# FOHA Dog Adoption Event Instructions: Dog Handlers

## Role Highlights

- Transport the dog to and from the event in your personal vehicle (note: whenever possible, the FOHA van will be used to transport all dogs attending the event).
- Handle the dog safely, monitoring interactions between the dog, children, and other dogs.
- Answer questions about the dog and FOHA.
- After the event, provide feedback on the dog's behavior.

## Before the Event

- Several days before the event, you'll receive an email from dogadoptionevents@foha.org with the list of dogs that are eligible to attend. Read the notes on each dog and choose one that matches the level of dog walker training you've completed. (Note that there may be last-minute changes to the dog list, depending on adoption applications and other factors.)
- Read about the dog you've chosen on their FOHA webpage and on the FOHA mobile app (it's in the iPhone app store or https://fohadogs.adalo.com/ on Android). Be ready to answer questions from event participants about the dog's age, history, personality, behavior, etc.
- Make sure your FOHA gear (shirt, hat, etc.) is washed and ready to wear!

## Day of the Event: Picking Up and Transporting Dog

- You are responsible for transporting your dog to and from the event, unless the FOHA van is available to bring all event dogs. We recommend using a "hammock" to keep the dog in the back seat. (These can be purchased online, but ask the Adoption Events Team if you'd like to borrow one.) You can also use a crate, if one will fit in your car.
- In the adoption office: Grab an "I'm at an off-site event" sign to put on your dog's kennel door. Get a tagged collar from the "FOHA TAGGED COLLARS" bin. In the off-site sign-out binder by the slip leads, fill out the dog's name, your name, phone number, and FOHA tag # from the collar you chose. Grab some poop bags and treats. (High-value treats may help the dog in a new setting.)
- Walk, play, and let your dog burn off some energy!
- You may want to brush and/or freshen up your dog. Grooming supplies are in the office and in the grooming room in the upper kennel building.
- DO NOT drive to the event with your windows down. The dog can jump out of the window…it has happened!

## At the Event: General Instructions

- When you arrive, check in at the FOHA tent/table to get an "Adopt Me" vest for your dog. You can then hang out at the table or walk your dog around the immediate area.
- Dogs MUST wear a SLIP LEAD and a HARNESS at events.
- Please give your dog your full attention, especially when introducing it to children.
- Please DO NOT allow anyone to hold your dog's leash other than FOHA volunteers. If you need a break, ask the Event Lead to take your dog.
- Please limit your dog's treats at the event. If you'd like to give them a small treat or have a snack yourself, please move away from other dogs to prevent any jealousy. Please do not bring any long-lasting chews or bully sticks.
- If an incident happens with your dog, please stay calm and find the FOHA event lead immediately to provide details.
- If someone is interested in adopting the dog that you are handling, please call over the FOHA Event Lead to speak with the adopter.

## At the Event: Dog Handling

- Watch your dog's body language for signs of FAS (fear, anxiety, and stress). If your dog seems stressed, you can move them away to a quieter, less-crowded area and see if that helps.
- Please remind people to approach your dog slowly and not lean over or get in the dog's face. Allow the dog to come to them.
- It is OK and ENCOURAGED to guide children on the proper way to approach your dog and to ask them not to hug or get in the dog's face.
- For safety, we recommend keeping your dog away from other dogs as much as possible, just like we do at the shelter. On-leash meetings are not always the ideal way for dogs to meet. If someone attending the event has a dog with them, is interested in adopting your dog, and wants the two dogs to meet, ask them to speak with the FOHA Event Lead. They will get information on submitting an application and setting up a supervised dog introduction at the shelter.
- If your dog is not doing well at the event (or just gets tired), you are welcome to leave early. Please let the FOHA Event Lead know that you are leaving.

## After the Event: Back at the Shelter

- If your dog is returning to the shelter after 3:30, make sure they get their dinner, which will likely be in the fridge (in their kennel building) with their name on it.
- Put the dog back in their run. Put a clothespin on the day-of-the-week sign. Make sure the spring clip is back on the kennel door latch and that the door is secure.
- Return their tagged collar and event sign back to the Adoption Office. Note the time you returned in the off-site events binder.

## After the Event: Comments About Your Dog

Please share observations about your dog's personality/behavior at the event using one or more of the methods listed below. Consider:

- How did the dog do around people?
- How did they do in the car?
- Did they interact with kids? If so, how did it go?
- Any concerning behaviors we should know about?

**Methods for sharing feedback:**

- Under the dog's profile in the FOHA mobile app (Search 'FOHA' in Apple store or go to https://fohadogs.adalo.com/ on Android phones)
- On the far right column of the "choose a dog" spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VwNR1ZTVrmhOhgSpm12CU9nfKO31AFBfsUrcxZGkB0w/edit?usp=sharing
- On the dog's FOHA webpage: www.foha.org (please avoid posting notes about any concerning behaviors you observed; share those via the internal-only methods listed above, instead).
