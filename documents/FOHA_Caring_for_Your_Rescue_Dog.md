# CARING FOR YOUR RESCUE DOG

## What To Expect When Adopting A Rescue Dog

You have just adopted a rescue dog and they are finally in their forever home, but your dog does not understand that yet. After all the changes and—in some cases—hardships they've experienced, they most likely are confused, stressed out, and even scared.

It's important to be prepared for bringing your new dog home so that you can ease the dog's transition.

If this is not your first dog, please keep in mind that—aside from some possible breed-specific characteristics—every dog is unique. This document provides guidance on how to set both yourself and your new dog up for success.

## What to Have on Hand Before Taking Your FOHA Dog Home

The following supplies are essential:

- Bed or special blanket
- Baby gate, if necessary
- Water and food bowls
- Brush
- Enzyme-based stain cleaner (for example, Nature's Miracle)
- Food (please see the section called "Food and Feeding" in this document)
- Poop bags
- Toys—Kongs and Nylabones are safe for strong chewers. Rawhide is not recommended since it can pose a choking hazard.
- Training treats—lots of them. If your dog enjoys their kibble, you may also use some of their daily allocation for treats.
- Bitter apple repellent (for dogs prone to chewing on things they're not supposed to).

## Pickup Day

When you come to the shelter to pick up your FOHA dog, bring with you:

- An ID tag with your dog's name and phone number on it (PetSmart or Petco have kiosks where you can have tags made). If needed, FOHA will provide a temporary ID tag.
- Standard 6-foot leash—We do not permit use of pinch collars or retractable leashes
- Collar—a Martingale collar, which should be worn at all times
- Harness—If your dog is not ready for harness training, this can be finalized later
- A going-home package from the shelter that contains:
  - A folder with adoption paperwork
  - Information about your dog's medical history, food preferences, and behavioral notes
  - A slip lead
  - A one-month supply of appropriate weight-based flea/tick preventative
  - A dose of heartworm preventative

## Dog Adoption Fees

FOHA accepts payment by credit card (Visa, MasterCard, Amex, Discover), but we also accept cash or checks. The adoption fees are:

- Puppy (under 1 year old): $425
- Adult: $375
- Senior-Care-Plan-eligible dogs: [variable]

All adoption fees are tax-deductible.

## Coming Home—The First Week

### Day 1: Let Your Dog Decompress

As exciting as it may be, don't invite friends and family over right away. Give your new dog a few days to adjust to their new home before introducing them to lots of new people.

- Keep your dog away from potential hazards (stairs, televisions, appliances, bicycles, etc.)
- Limit exposure to overwhelming stimuli (new people, other pets, loud noises)

### The First Few Weeks (or longer)

Be patient with your new dog. Avoid situations that might be too stressful during this adjustment period.

**GENERAL GUIDELINES:**
- Adjustment Period vs. Long-term: Some behaviors may improve as your dog settles in, but some may require ongoing training and management.
